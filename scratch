NICE TO HAVE:
[] - Profile Page - Settings Page = where users could define some rules on edit, delete, maybe color theme
[] add a night time entry field asking "Summarize today in one word"
[] Once you register it should prompt you to create your commitment
[] After commitment is set, offer journal entry immediately (allow the user to skip
[] points for logging in and points for posting
[] streaks aren't working perfectly. Need to check logic


MUST HAVE:
[] Dark Mode
[] Change email address
[] Delete the account
