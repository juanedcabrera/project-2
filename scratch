[] add a night time entry field asking "Summarize today in one word"
[] Once you register it should prompt you to create your commitment
[] After commitment is set, offer journal entry immediately (allow the user to skip)
[] add a commitment section to commitment saying "What will you commit?" - placeholder text with example
[] points for logging in and points for posting

MUST HAVE:
[] submit buttons are showing white on white on mobile
[] show.ejs has bad timezones at the bottom
[] 3 most recent show as indented
[] cap character limits on entries
[] calendar has 31 days for april
[] calendar has extra row that doesn't exist
